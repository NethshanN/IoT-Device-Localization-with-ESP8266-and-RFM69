# IoT Device Localization with ESP8266, ATmega328P and RFM69
Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation of a LoRa-based IoT system utilizing ESP8266, ATmega328P, and LoRa RF communication for long-range wireless data transmission. The system is designed for location tracking by collecting RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data and transmitting it to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for further analysis. A machine learning model, discussed in the next section, is used for estimating the device's location.
Repository Contents
This repository includes the following:
ðŸ“Œ Arduino Code:
â€¢	ESP8266 firmware for handling Wi-Fi communication and cloud integration
â€¢	ATmega328P firmware for LoRa module management and data transmission
â€¢	Implementation of MQTT and HTTP protocols for seamless data exchange
ðŸ“Œ Schematics & Circuit Diagrams:
â€¢	Detailed wiring diagrams of ESP8266, ATmega328P, and LoRa module connections
â€¢	Power supply and interfacing details
ðŸ“Œ Project Documentation:
â€¢	Explanation of system architecture and working principle
â€¢	Step-by-step guide on setting up the hardware and software
â€¢	Details on LoRa communication parameters (frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth)
How It Works
1.	Data Acquisition:
o	The IoT device collects sensor data and RSSI values for location tracking.
2.	LoRa Communication:
o	The ATmega328P handles the LoRa module, encoding and transmitting packets to a remote gateway.
3.	Cloud Integration (ThingSpeak):
o	The ESP8266 connects to the internet and uploads RSSI data to ThingSpeak for storage and further processing.
4.	Machine Learning for Location Estimation:
o	Collected RSSI data is later processed using a machine learning model.
